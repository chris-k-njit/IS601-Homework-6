## Homework Objectives
### Continue to build on top of all other homeworks, now homework 5

1.  Github Actions: Ensure that tests are ran when pushing to master/main branch of repo and ensure test results all pass on GitHub when reviewing repo there.

2.  Environment Variables: Ensure that my key is hidden within the .env file, and that .gitgnore ignores the env.

3.  Logging: Log outputs from my program to track output data (i.e. Like a print statement). Need to find effective way of viewing data found in variables.
